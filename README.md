### Project 3: Turkish Sentiment Analysis for Customer Feedback

**Linguistic Challenge**  
Turkish is a morphologically rich, agglutinative language where single words can express complex meanings through suffixes. Standard NLP models trained on English fail dramatically on Turkish text.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Technical Approach**

```python
turkish_nlp_pipeline = {
    "morphological_analysis": {
        "library": "Zemberek NLP",
        "capabilities": [
            "Word segmentation",
            "Suffix parsing",
            "Root word extraction",
            "Part-of-speech tagging"
        ],
        "example": {
            "word": "evlerimizden",
            "analysis": "ev+ler+imiz+den",
            "translation": "from our houses"
        }
    },
    
    "preprocessing": {
        "tokenization": "Morphology-aware splitting",
        "normalization": "Spelling correction, slang handling",
        "stopwords": "Custom Turkish stopword list",
        "stemming": "Zemberek root extraction"
    },
    
    "embedding_strategy": {
        "approach": "Domain-specific Word2Vec",
        "corpus": "Turkish customer reviews (2M documents)",
        "dimensions": 300,
        "window_size": 5,
        "training_epochs": 50
    },
    
    "classification_model": {
        "architecture": "Bidirectional LSTM",
        "layers": [
            "Embedding layer (300d)",
            "BiLSTM (128 units) x 2",
            "Attention mechanism",
            "Dense (64 units, ReLU)",
            "Output (3 classes: pos/neg/neutral)"
        ],
        "regularization": "Dropout (0.5) + L2"
    }
}
```

<td width="50%">

**Performance Metrics**

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Overall Accuracy | 91.2% | On test set (10K reviews) |
| Precision (Positive) | 93.1% | Low false positive rate |
| Recall (Negative) | 89.7% | Good negative detection |
| F1-Score (Neutral) | 87.4% | Challenging class |
| Inference Time | 45ms | CPU inference (i7-9700K) |

**Training Details**
- Dataset: 50K labeled Turkish reviews (restaurants, e-commerce, hotels)
- Class balance: Weighted loss to handle imbalance
- Augmentation: Synonym replacement, back-translation
- Validation: 5-fold cross-validation

**Real-World Applications**
- Restaurant feedback analysis
- E-commerce review sentiment
- Social media brand monitoring
- Customer support prioritization

**Key Insights**
- Morphological analysis crucial (15% accuracy improvement)
- Domain-specific embeddings outperform multilingual models
